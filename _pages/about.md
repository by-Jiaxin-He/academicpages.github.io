Welcome to My World
I'm a proud graduate of Southwestern University of Finance and Economics (SWUFE) where I specialized in Actuarial Science. My academic journey ignited a passion for blending economic theories with advanced modeling techniques to solve real-world challenges.

Beyond spreadsheets and data analytics, you'll find me embracing an active lifestyle – fitness is my sanctuary for building both physical and mental resilience. I thrive on connecting with diverse minds and believe every conversation sparks growth. Always open to meeting passionate people and making new friends worldwide!

Feel free to reach out – let's discuss economics, models, or workout routines!
